<p>This lecture is going to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discuss the concept of parametric vs non-parametric models</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a new dataset for spectra fitting problems that you might see if using analytical chemistry techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Summarize several of the most common non-parametric models</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Non-parametric models<a class="headerlink" href="#non-parametric-models" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Parametric models</strong> fit parameters within models to represent some underlying data. Everything we’ve done so far has been a parametric model. A few examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Linear regression</p></li>
<li><p>Polynomial regression (which is really linear regression with polynomial features)</p></li>
<li><p>Logistic regression</p></li>
<li><p>Non-linear regression (like we implemented with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lmfit</span></code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Neural networks</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-parametric models</strong> don’t explicitly fit parameters, but use other approaches to predict data. A few examples, some of which we will cover today:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decision trees</p></li>
<li><p>kernel regression</p></li>
<li><p>K-nearest neighbors (KNN)</p></li>
<li><p>Gaussian Processes</p></li>
<li><p>…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Parametric models tend to work best when you have a lot of data, and conversely non-parametric models tend to work better with small amounts of data. Some of this is because of differences in flexibility of the models, and part is because non-parametric models tend to get more computationally expensive with increasingly large datasets!</p>
<p>Because non-parametric models are not learning underlying patterns in the dataset, they also tend to have trouble extrapolating to data that is different from the training dataset.</p>

<h2>Example dataset - IR spectra<a class="headerlink" href="#example-dataset-ir-spectra" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s consider fitting models to experimental IR spectra. These models might be useful if you have an experimental measurement that is a bit noisy, or perhaps you want to predict the spectra in between data points.</p>

<h2>Train/Val/Test split (given every 10th spectra, predict the rest)<a class="headerlink" href="#train-val-test-split-given-every-10th-spectra-predict-the-rest" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>As always, let’s start with a train/val/test split. To make this interesting, let’s to 10/45/45 train/val/test. We’ll sample the training set uniformly, so that this is representative of a challenge where we have a low-quality IR spectra and want to predict a high-quality one.</p>
<p>That is, given one one tenth of the data, predict the rest.</p>

<h2>K-Nearest Neighbors<a class="headerlink" href="#k-nearest-neighbors" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>One of the strategies we discussed for predicting values of unseen data is to simply look at the nearest training data and average those predictions. This strategy is known as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). <strong>K</strong> is the number of neighbors that we want to average over.</p>
<p>This is very easy to implement in sklearn! Non-parametric models implement the same interface, and are required to have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict</span></code> functions.</p>

<p>Note that KNN with uniform weights yields a piecewise function with zero derivatives everywhere (except at the discontinuities). This could lead to very unhelpful optimization results if you’re trying to minimize or maximize the function/model!</p>

<h2>Decision Trees<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-trees" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Decision trees are a non-parametric model that recursively splits the data. The general strategy is something like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Start with all data in the same bin</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a random (or best) feature. Find the value of the feature that best separates the bin into two bins with large difference in mean values</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat for all bins until the bins are a minimum size or progress is not being made, or we hit a max depth (many possible choices here!)
One really nice advantage of this process is that we can examine the learned rules to see how the model is making its decisions!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see this in practice using sklearn!</p>

<p>Notice that decision trees also have the property that all points within a bin end up with the same value, which means that the gradient everywhere is zero. We expect the spectra to be somewhat smooth, so this makes the predictions look a bit strange!</p>

<p>We can visualize the decisions made in the model. To keep this easy to read we’ll limit the tree to a max depth of 2. If we had many possible features, these splits would also help us understand which features were most important.</p>

<h2>Random forests (a bunch of random trees)<a class="headerlink" href="#random-forests-a-bunch-of-random-trees" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The decisions made in the decision tree process are usually stochastic. If you look at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DecisionTreeRegressor</span></code>, you’ll see there’s also an argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random_state</span></code> to control it’s outputs.</p>
<p>We can take advantage of this randomness to fit an ensemble of many similar decision trees, then report the average and standard deviation of that  ensemble to estimate uncertainty in the model predictions. This type of model is called a <strong>random forest</strong>. The same idea holds with many other stochastic models, but is particularly popular for decision trees.</p>

<p>Note the validation MAE here is a bit better than a single decision tree. This is a common pattern in machine learning and a technique that can be used to improve predictive power - fit an ensemble many identical models with different random initializations and average the predictions.</p>
