# Logistics/Notes
Monday 9/19
* **Lecture:** Overfitting, model capacity, simple feature selection
* Feedback from ML guest lectures was excellent. Quick discussion about class schedule. 
* Feedback from mid-term evals
    * Only ~10/50 responses
    * Quite bimodal (either people thought things are going really well, or it was too fast)
    * Common feedback:
        * Lectures move fast (please tell me when it's moving too fast or you want me to slow down!)
        * Homeworks can take a long time
        * Lots of code/functions/definitions/etc to understand
* HW3 posted (should be fairly straightforward based on lecture from Wednesday, please ask question on piazza and come to office hours!)
* Project proposal due noon 9/23 on gradescope
* Office hours as normal this week here: https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/F22-06-325/syllabus.html#personnel
* **jupyterhub:** I haven't seen any questions/etc in the past two weeks, so I think everything has stabilized and is working well!

Wednesday 9/7
* **Lecture:** Project overview, and intro to supervised regression
*  {doc}`projects/overview`
    * Email link sent to CATME to help with group/project assignment, please fill out by Friday!
    * Groups will be assigned over the weekend
    * You will have ~9/23 to investigate the project info, dataset, and write a short proposal on what you want to try. Feel free to ask for suggestions or clarifications in office hours!
* Please upload the practice to gradescope at the end of class!
* HW2 is posted, due Monday
* Office hours, updated on {doc}`syllabus`
    * Ulissi office hours Thurs 530-630 on zoom
    * Optional python lab Friday 330-430 DH 1102
* **jupyterhub:** Updated save tips at {doc}`software`
* **jupyterhub:** Save-to-pdf with chemical equations fixed (hopefully that works cleanly now!) https://github.com/ulissigroup/F22-06-325/blob/main/Dockerfile#L66
* **jupyterhub:** There appears to be a problem with JupyterLab RTC that might be causing the problems with saving files (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/12154). It's disabled now, so please let me know if there's still any problems
