# Finding optimal tours for the Travelling Salesman Problem

In the 19th century, William Rowan Hamilton formulated the TSP as a puzzle where one tries to generate a Hamiltonian cycle. A Hamiltonian cycle is a tour that visits every node in a graph. Overtime, this evolved to trying to find the most optimal(or shortest) possible route given a graph. Apart from the obvious uses of TSP in vehicle routing and supply chain operations, it can be used in a plethora of other applications such as circuit board design.

In the operation research field, this problem is modeled mathematically as an integer program. While this methodology is highly effective in defining the problem and finding the proven optimal solution, this problem is an NP-hard problem. As the number of nodes increase, the solve times exponentially increase. Thus, work has been done to utilize machine learning techniques to predict optimal (or near optimal) tours for a given network.

## Dataset/file format details
The dataset can be separated into 1 parts
1. Graph information
    * Customer ID
    * Customer Coordinate  (x,y)
2. Tour Information
    1. Optimal sequence of visiting customers
    2. Optimal cost of tour

Additional data can also be easily generated by randomly generating customers in a unit square space. Optimal solutions can be obtained by using current state of the art solvers such as Concorde.

## Hints and possible approaches
1. GCNN
    * The network can be defined as a graph with the links used to present potential arcs between customers
2. RL
    * We can build a model that learns from itself to generate optimal routes for a given network
    * Advantage: RL would not need the optimal solution for training the model

````{note}
You should think critically about the question how you want to set up your train/validation/test splits to simulate the challenge. 
* How do you represent your problem in the model?
* How would you know if your model is helpful?
* How do you extract the optimal tour from the model output?
````

## Suggested challenges

* Consider TSP variants such as mTSP(multiple salesman) or CVRP(multiple vehicles with a capacity limit)
* What if the optimal route is based on a different metric other than Euclidean distance?
