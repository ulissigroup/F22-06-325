    "# Using ML to Predict Catalyst Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Prof. Ulissi works on building computational datasets and machine learning models to predict the activity and selectivity of catalysts for various types of reactions. Many of these reactions are for renewable energy applications like hydrogen production, turning CO$_2$ into more valuable products, etc. The underlying simulations use quantum mechanical calculations (like you're learning about in your molecular foundations of ChE course), each of which is very slow. There are now many machine learning models (mostly graph neural networks) that can directly predict properties of these simulations. However, these models work much better for some catalyst surfaces and adsorbates than others, and we want your help in finding out how and when to trust these predictions!\n",

    "Scalable and cost-effective solutions to renewable energy storage are essential to addressing the world’s rising energy needs while reducing climate change. As illustrated in the figure below, as we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer power from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the storage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the potential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen. To be widely adopted, this process requires cost-effective solutions to running chemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An open challenge is finding low-cost catalysts to drive these reactions at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (Density Functional Theory, DFT), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the number of structures that may be tested. The use of AI or machine learning may provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations; reducing the time required from 24} hours to a second. This capability would transform the search for new catalysts from the present day practice of evaluating O(1,000) of handpicked candidates to the brute force search over millions or even billions of candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of OCP, we publicly released the world's largest quantum mechanical simulation dataset -- [OC20](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/master/DATASET.md) -- in the Fall of 2020 along with a suite of baselines and evaluation metrics. The creation of the dataset required over 70 million hours of compute. This dataset enables the exploration of techniques that will generalize across different catalyst materials and adsorbates. If successful, models trained on the dataset could enable the computational testing of millions of catalyst materials for a wide variety of chemical reactions. However, techniques that achieve the accuracies required** for practical impact are still beyond reach and remain an open area for research, thus encouraging research in this important area to help in meeting the world's energy needs in the decades ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "** The computational catalysis community often aims for an adsorption energy MAE of 0.1-0.2 eV for practical relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![California energy demand](./california_demand.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of efficient and economic catalysts (materials) are needed to enable the widespread use of renewable energy technologies. A common approach in discovering high performance catalysts is using molecular simulations. Specifically, each simulation models the interaction of a catalyst surface with molecules that are commonly seen in electrochemical reactions. By predicting these interactions accurately, the catalyst's impact on the overall rate of a chemical reaction may be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important quantity in screening catalysts is their adsorption energy for the molecules, referred to as `adsorbates', involved in the reaction of interest. The adsorption energy may be found by simulating the interaction of the adsorbate molecule on the surface of the catalyst to find their resting or relaxed energy, i.e., how tightly the adsorbate binds to the catalyst's surface (visualized below). The rate of the chemical reaction, a value of high practical importance, is then commonly approximated using simple functions of the adsorption energy. The goal of this tutorial specifically and the project overall is to encourage research and benchmark progress towards training ML models to approximate this relaxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, during the course of a relaxation, given an initial set of atoms and their positions, the task is to iteratively estimate atomic forces and update atomic positions until a relaxed state is reached. The energy corresponding to the relaxed state is the structure's 'relaxed energy'. The relaxed energy is very useful for predicting the activity of a catalyst surface!\n",

Data is stored in PyTorch Geometric [Data](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/data.html) objects and stored in LMDB files. For each task we include several sized training splits. Validation/Test splits are broken into several subsplits: In Domain (ID), Out of Domain Adsorbate (OOD-Ads), Out of Domain Catalyast (OOD-Cat) and Out of Domain Adsorbate and Catalyst (OOD-Both). Split sizes are summarized below:\n",

In this notebook, we generate sample data in the same format as the OC20 dataset; however, we use a faster method that is less accurate called effective-medium theory (EMT) because our DFT calculations are too computationally expensive to run here. EMT is great for demonstration purposes but not accurate enough for our actual catalysis applications. Below is a structural relaxation of a catalyst system, a propane (C3H8) adsorbate on a copper (Cu) surface. Throughout this tutorial a surface may be referred to as a slab and the combination of an adsorbate and a surface as an adslab."

    "### Structural relaxations\n",
    "\n",
    "A structural relaxation or structure optimization is the process of iteratively updating atom positions to find the atom positions that minimize the energy of the structure. Standard optimization methods are used in structural relaxations — below we use the Limited-Memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm. The step number, time, energy, and force max are printed at each optimization step. Each step is considered one example because it provides all the information we need to train models for the S2EF task and the entire set of steps is referred to as a trajectory. Visualizing intermediate structures or viewing the entire trajectory can be illuminating to understand what is physically happening and to look for problems in the simulation, especially when we run ML-driven relaxations. Common problems one may look out for - atoms excessively overlapping/colliding with each other and atoms flying off into random directions."

    "###  Limitations\n",
    "The OpenCatalyst project is motivated by the problems we face due to climate change, many of which require innovative solutions to reduce energy usage and replace traditional chemical feedstocks with renewable alternatives. For example, one of the most energy intensive chemical processes is the development of new electrochemical catalysts for ammonia fertilizer production that helped to feed the world’s growing population during the 20th century. This is also an illustrative example of possible unintended consequences as advancements in chemistry and materials may be used for numerous purposes. As ammonia fertilization increased in use, its overuse in today’s farming has led to ocean “dead zones” and its production is very carbon intensive. Knowledge and techniques used to create ammonia were also transferred to the creation of explosives during wartime. We hope to steer the use of ML for atomic simulations to societally-beneficial uses by training and testing our approaches on datasets, such as OC20, that were specifically designed to address chemical reactions useful for addressing climate change.4\n",

    "### Next Steps for State of the Art in Catalyst Simulation Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "While progress has been well underway - https://opencatalystproject.org/leaderboard.html, a considerable gap still exists between state-of-the-art models and our target goals. We offer some some general thoughts as to next steps for the readers to ponder on or explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GNN depth has consistenly improved model performance. What limitations to depth are there? How far can we push deeper models for OC20? \n",
    "* Our best performing models have little to no physical biases encoded. Can we incorporate such biases to improve our models? Experiments with physically inspired embeddings have had no advantage vs. random initializations, are there better ways to incorporate this information into the models?\n",
    "* Uncertainty estimation will play an important role in later stages of the project when it comes to large scale screening. How can we get reliable uncertainty estimates from large scale GNNs?\n",
    "* Are we limited to message-passing GNNs? Can we leverage alternative architectures for similiar or better performance?\n",
    "* Trajectories are nothing more than sequential data points. How can we use sequential modeling techniques to model the full trajectory?\n",
    "\n",
    "OC20 is a large and diverse dataset with many splits. For those with limited resources but unsure where to start, we provide some general recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The IS2RE-direct task is a great place to start. With the largest training set containing ~460k data points, this task is easily accesible for those with even just a single GPU.\n",
    "* Those interested in the more general S2EF task don't need to train on the All set to get meaningful performance.\n",
    "    * Results on the 2M dataset are often sufficient to highlight model improvements.\n",
    "    * For a fixed compute budget (e.g. fixed number of steps), training on the All set often leads to better performance.\n",
    "* The S2EF 200k dataset is fairly noisy, trying to find meaningful trends using this dataset can be difficult."
