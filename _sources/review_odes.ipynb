    "So, evidently it is not exactly periodic in the beginning, but seems to take some time to settle down into a periodic rhythm. That seems to be the case, because if it didn't we would expect to see a continued spiral in or out of this limit cycle. Another way we can assess this quantitatively is to look at the peak positions in our solution. We return to an event type of solution. We seek an event where the derivative $dx/dt=0$, and it is a maximum, which means $x'$ starts positive, becomes zero, and then is negative. Note this is appropriate for this problem, where there is only one, periodic maximum. For other problems, you might need a different approach.\n",
