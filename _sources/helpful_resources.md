# Helpful Resources
**Video resources:**
* [John Kitchin's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnKitchin/videos)
    * Very relevant, starts at the basics and works up. Accompanying PDF textbooks available too!
    * The notes for 06-623 are also very helpful. https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/f19-06623/
    * [Prof. Kitchin also self-publishes guides to many of these topics](https://pointbreezepubs.gumroad.com/). Ask Prof. Ulissi for a discount code if you want to buy something!
