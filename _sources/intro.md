# Introduction & License

This jupyter book will provide all of the content for the course. It will also contain references and links to other resources and additional materials.

We will do some things a bit differently from 06-262, so please take a few moments to check out the [syllabus](syllabus.html) and the [software environment](software.html) sections. 

Check out the content pages on the left hand side!
